## Gullak - 
Gullak is a new and secured digital form of investment at a large scale, which is inspired by Small Self Help Groups(SSHGs) in rural areas and small towns. Gullak is a central bank account shared between women. Any woman can add money to the Gullak account. Collected money of Gullak is then invested in the market to earn profit (For example, there can be a tie up between private or public firm and our web app. The money will be used by those firms for bussiness activities and share of profit earned is transferred back to the Gullak account). Woman can redeem amount any time in future, and the share (principal amount + profit share) will be transferred back to the woman's account.
